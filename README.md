# Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning Algorithm
This repository contains Python code for classifying breast cancer tumours as malignant or benign using two different machine learning models: Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The goal is to build and compare the performance of these models in classifying breast cancer tumours based on features extracted.
# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset includes features computed from a digitised image of a breast mass sampled with a fine needle aspirating (FNA). The target variable determines whether the tumour is malignant or benign, and the features define the properties of cell nuclei that are visible in the image.
# Models
# 1. Logistic Regression
The Logistic Regression model is a simple and interpretable linear classification algorithm. In this project, we have implemented a Logistic Regression classifier to predict whether a tumour is malignant or benign based on the extracted features from the biopsy images. 
# 2. Support Vector Machine(SVM)
The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful classification algorithm known for its ability to handle complex data distributions. SVM aims to find a hyperplane that best separates malignant and benign tumours by maximizing the margin between the two classes.
