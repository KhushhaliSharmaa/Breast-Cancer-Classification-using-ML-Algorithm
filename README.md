# Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning Algorithm
This repository contains Python code for classifying breast cancer tumours as malignant or benign using two different machine learning models: Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The goal is to build and compare the performance of these models in classifying breast cancer tumours based on features extracted.
# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset includes features computed from a digitised image of a breast mass sampled with a fine needle aspirating (FNA). The target variable determines whether the tumour is malignant or benign, and the features define the properties of cell nuclei visible in the image.
# Models
# 1. Logistic Regression
The Logistic Regression model is a simple and interpretable linear classification algorithm. In this project, we have implemented a Logistic Regression classifier to predict whether a tumour is malignant or benign based on the extracted features from the biopsy images. 
# 2. Support Vector Machine(SVM)
The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful classification algorithm known for its ability to handle complex data distributions. SVM aims to find a hyperplane that best separates malignant and benign tumours by maximizing the margin between the two classes.
# Results
The results and performance of Logistic Regression and SVM models are discussed in the notebooks.
# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the implementation of two different machine learning models, Logistic Regression and SVM, for classifying breast cancer tumours. By using this repository, you can learn how to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate their performance.
