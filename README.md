# Breast-Cancer-Classification-using-ML-Algorithm
This repository contains Python code for classifying breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using two different machine learning models: Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The goal is to build and compare the performance of these models in classifying breast cancer tumors based on features extracted.
# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset includes features computed from a digitised image of a breast mass sampled with a fine needle aspirating (FNA). The target variable determines whether the tumour is malignant or benign, and the features define properties of cell nuclei that are visible in the image.
